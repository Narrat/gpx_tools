First off, the string should not use 0xFF as a delimiter.  Build a linked
list backwards and try to make things fit.

struct outNode {
   char *string;
   int type;  // 0 = static string, 1 = autofit, 2 = smart truncation
}

Mimic the smart truncation as per GPX Spinner (thanks Brian [GPX Spinner
author] for the info).

* Remove un-allowed words
* Replace the string " and " with "&" or "+" depending on which one is
  an allowed character.
* Replace words with a short version:
  one => 1
  to => 2
  two => 2
  three => 3
  for => 4
  four => 4
  five => 5
  six => 6
  seven => 7
  eight => 8
  ate => 8
  nine => 9
  zero => 0
  ... continue up with numbers?
* Remove unneeded words (and, the, a, an, of)
* Remove remaining spaces
* Remove non-alphanumeric
* Remove vowels starting at the right
* Truncate, but keep any numbers at the end

Before starting and after each stage, condense multiple spaces into one.
Stop truncation when it fits.

Remember to leave at least 1 character from the shrinking / truncation.
