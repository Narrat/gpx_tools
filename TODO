Short name truncation, from Brian - GPX Spinner:

Sure. Here's the comments and some snippets of code to explain what I'm 
doing.

# remove un-allowed chars, but leave the space char so we can match ' and ' 
and other whole words

# get out of here if nothing to do
return 'Geocache' if &is_blank($text);

# first replace ' and ' with '&' or '+' depending on which char is allowed
# replace other words with short version, e.g. for=>4, to=>2, zero=>0, 
one=>1, etc.
# remove unneeded words ('and', 'the', 'a', 'an', 'of')
# remove remaining spaces
# remove non-alphanumeric
# remove vowels starting at right
# lastly, truncate but keep any numbers at the end

at each stage before "remove remaining spaces" I also condense any multi-
spaces left after removing words.

I only request that you don't advertise your program as a replacement or 
competitor of Spinner. Let it stand on it's own.

Good luck with your program!
