waypoint:  Parse waypoint date
gpxfilter:  Filter by date

Reference points can start with TR, DB, or possibly others.  The %I format only
removes the first two characters if they are "GC".  Make %i that will always
remove the first two characters, and make new format codes for just the first
two characters and just the first two if they are not GC.  It would be nice
to have "GC1234" and "TB1234" show up as "1234" and "1234-TB" if possible
